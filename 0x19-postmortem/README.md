Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on March 5, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM (UTC).
Impact: The user authentication and login system experienced disruptions, causing login failures for 30% of active users.
Root Cause: Inefficient database connection pooling led to a surge in connections, resulting in service degradation.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: Monitoring alerts signaled unusually high server load.
10:15 AM: Investigation revealed a spike in database connection errors.
11:30 AM: Database administrators identified inefficient connection pooling mechanisms.
12:00 PM: Incident escalated to senior engineers and management.
1:30 PM: Resolution implemented, optimizing connection pooling settings.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Inefficient database connection pooling mechanisms caused rapid exhaustion of connections during peak usage.
Resolution: Optimized connection pooling settings and improved resource management prevented resource exhaustion.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Review and optimize connection pooling configurations regularly.
Implement automated load testing to identify performance bottlenecks.
Enhance monitoring systems for proactive detection of database issues.
Conduct training sessions for improved incident response and troubleshooting.
Document lessons learned and establish post-incident review procedures.
By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective measures, we aim to enhance system stability and ensure uninterrupted service for our users.
